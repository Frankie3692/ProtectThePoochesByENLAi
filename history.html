        <h2>Beginings</h2>
       
        <p>Before losing our funding and going bankrupt in 2008, our company <strike><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxe_lTnxJIo"> [Redacted] </a></strike> specialized in trans-humanism applications. Transhumanism is the belief that human beings should be permitted to use technology to modify and enhance human cognition and bodily function. However, to keep a long story short, maping the human mind via a nural link onto a computer proved to be too dificult to accomplish, and even more difficult to find suitable test subjects in the preferred age range, and thus the project failed. With our main project in ruins most of our investors backed out, leaving our institute to go bankrupt in the year 2008. <span class="souls">Some motives run deeper than money.</span>   </p>

        <h2>The Future</h2>

        <p>
            After our brief time as a research firm ended in 2008, our founder (who you can read about on his page) decided to repurpose our resources into a more charitable cause. In 2012 he turned our old facilities into shelters for dogs who require help of all sorts. To make sure all of our resources go to helping our furry friends, we implemented our experimental Ai program to help run our business. It takes care of all of our marketing and even maintains the website you are on right now. While it takes care of that, our time and energy can go to where it's really needed.
